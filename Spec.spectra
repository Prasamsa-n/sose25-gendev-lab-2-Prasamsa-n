spec Spec

// This is a Spectra specification for a Smart Room Lighting System.
// It controls room lights and window blinds based on occupancy, sunlight, and time of day.

// ---------------------------
// Environment Variables
// ---------------------------

env boolean isOccupied;       // Someone is present in the room
env boolean isDayTime;        // It is currently daytime
env boolean isSunny;          // Sunlight is bright enough

// ---------------------------
// System Variables
// ---------------------------

sys boolean mainLightOn;      // Main room light is ON
sys boolean windowBlindsOpen; // Window blinds are OPEN
sys boolean nightLampOn;      // Night lamp is ON

// ---------------------------
// Assumptions (about environment)
// ---------------------------

// Initial Assumptions
asm ini !isOccupied;          // Initially, room is unoccupied
asm ini isDayTime;            // Assume it starts during daytime

// Safety Assumptions
asm alw (isDayTime -> next(isDayTime | !isDayTime));  
// Time of day changes gradually, not instantly flipping

asm alw !(isOccupied & !isDayTime & isSunny);  
// At night, the sun can't be shining even if someone is present

// Justice Assumptions
asm alwEv isDayTime;          
// It will eventually become daytime again

asm alwEv isOccupied;         
// Someone will eventually enter the room

// ---------------------------
// Guarantees (system behavior)
// ---------------------------

// Initial Guarantees
gar ini !mainLightOn;         
// Main light is off initially

gar ini !nightLampOn;         
// Night lamp is off initially

// Safety Guarantees
gar alw (isOccupied & !isSunny -> mainLightOn);  
// If the room is occupied and it's not sunny, turn on the main light

gar alw (!isOccupied -> !mainLightOn);           
// If no one is in the room, main light should be off

gar alw (isDayTime & isSunny -> windowBlindsOpen); 
// If itâ€™s sunny during the day, open the blinds

gar alw (!isDayTime -> nightLampOn);             
// Turn on night lamp if it's night

// Justice Guarantees
gar alwEv !isOccupied -> !mainLightOn;           
// When room becomes empty, the light will eventually turn off

gar alwEv isDayTime -> !nightLampOn;             
// During the day, the night lamp will eventually turn off
